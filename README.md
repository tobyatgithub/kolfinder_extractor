## Known Issues & Workflow Considerations

### Current Limitations

While the extension efficiently handles the data extraction process, users should be aware of some workflow considerations:

1. **Post-Export Data Management**
   - The copied data, when pasted into spreadsheets or Notion, still requires manual organization
   - No built-in tracking system for outreach status or decision-making
   - Limited ability to add custom notes or status flags within the original interface

2. **Workflow Gaps**
   - No integrated system for tracking:
     - Outreach history
     - Response status
     - Decision status (passed/interested/contacted)
     - Follow-up reminders
   - Manual effort required to maintain status updates across different platforms

### Recommended Workarounds

Until a more comprehensive solution is developed, consider these workarounds:

1. **Using Google Sheets**
   - Add additional columns for status tracking
   - Use color coding for different stages
   - Create a simple kanban board using column headers

2. **Using Notion**
   - Create a database with additional properties for tracking
   - Use status properties for tracking outreach stages
   - Utilize timeline views for managing follow-ups

### Future Improvement Ideas

- Integration with CRM systems
- Built-in status tracking functionality
- Custom field additions for notes and status
- Export options to various project management tools
- Automated follow-up reminders
